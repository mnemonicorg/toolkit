In an effort to use materials for potential accountability purposes, it was recognised that a standardised metadata scheme was needed for all visual content.

Metadata fields we currently collect by field description and purpose

The Syrian Archive organised the preserved materials by cataloging them according to the categories used by the Independent International Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab Republi, set up by the United Nations OHCHR in 2011.

These categories include
- Massacres and other unlawful killing
- Arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention
- Hostage-taking
- Enforced disappearance
- Torture and ill-treatment of detainees
- Sexual and gender-based violence
- Violations of childrenâ€™s rights
- Unlawful attacks
- Violations against specifically protected persons and objects
- Use of illegal weapons
- Sieges and violations of economic, social and cultural rights
- Arbitrary and forcible displacement

Additional value is added to the material by recording as much metadata and chain of custody information as possible. The recording of location, date and origin of video evidence are done in order to contextualise the material and help users identify and understand when, where and what happened in a specific incident.
