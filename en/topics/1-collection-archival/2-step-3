These categories include
- Massacres and other unlawful killing
- Arbitrary arrest and unlawful detention
- Hostage-taking
- Enforced disappearance
- Torture and ill-treatment of detainees
- Sexual and gender-based violence
- Violations of childrenâ€™s rights
- Unlawful attacks
- Violations against specifically protected persons and objects
- Use of illegal weapons

Additional value is added to the material by recording as much metadata and chain of custody information as possible. The recording of location, date and origin of video evidence are done in order to contextualise the material and help users identify and understand when, where and what happened in a specific incident.
