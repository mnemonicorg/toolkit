title: "Step 1: Establish database of credible sources for content"
---

The Syrian Archive has identified more than three hundred sources through following credible and verified social media accounts and channels of individual citizen journalists and larger media houses, such as YouTube, Facebook and Telegram. Many of those providing video documentation began to do so in late 2011 or early 2012 and have published their work in other credible media outlets as well. It is important to note that many if not all of these sources are partisan, and thus require caution with regards to their claims.

Trusted sources report from different cities in Syria in order to spread news and information about alleged violations occurring in their areas. The Syrian Archive works with field reporters like Yasser Al Haj, a journalist from Aleppo who began his career in 2012 and continues working until today. 

The Syrian Archive also works with local and international news agencies, human rights organisations, as well as the Syrian Civil Defense (more colloquially known as the White Helmets) team, local field clinics and hospitals. Additionally, some video evidence analysed was sent to the Syrian Archive directly by  reporters and was not previously been posted on social media platforms.
