To verify the source of the video, it needs to be established that the source of the video on the Syrian Archive’s verified list of credible sources. If the source is not an existing trusted source, determine the new source’s credibility by evaluating

- Whether the source is familiar to the Syrian Archive or to its existing professional network of Syrian journalists and media activists
- Whether the source's content and reportage been reliable in the past. This is determined by evaluating how long the source has been reporting and how active they are
- Where the source is based. This is determined by evaluating whether videos uploaded are consistent and mostly from a specific location where the source is based
- Whether the video account uses a logo and whether this logo is consistently used across videos
- Whether the uploader aggregates videos from other news organizations and YouTube accounts, or whether they upload mostly user-generated content.
